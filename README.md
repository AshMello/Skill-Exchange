They can select skills from a variety of categories and then add a description about their specific skill and duration of time 
which they are available to teach it.

When users are ready to make a skill trade with another user, they can navigate to the Trade page. The Trade page allows users to select a category of skill which they would like to learn. Once a category is selected, descriptions of lessons offered by other users in that category are displayed along with an email button.
